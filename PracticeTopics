SVN vs GIT

Docker advantages in devops:
  1. Docker maintains the stability across all the environments (i.e. dev/uat/prod) deployment.
  2. Use of the same image across all level of environmental deployment.
  3. We can run the containers independent of platform.
  4. It maintains isolated set of binaries utilized by application.
  5. Provide robust solution for continues deployment.
Difference between container and vm:
  1. More scalable (i.e. we can run any number of container)
  2. We can run containers much easier and faster then virtual machine.
  3. Occupies less space compared to virtual machine.
  4. Easy to migrate.
